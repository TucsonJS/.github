# TucsonJS
Hello and welcome to the future home of the TucsonJS community.

## 🏗️ Coming soon... 
Pardon the dust while everything gets set up.

## 👀 Just a sneak peek... 
The core mission of TucsonJS will be to create an inclusive and uplifting community for JavaScript developers in Tucson, AZ (and nearby surrounding areas).

As of this commit we are not associated with [Tucson Webstackers](https://github.com/webstackers) which used to use the TucsonJS name. That being said, I would love to get in touch with them to discuss carrying on the TucsonJS name-torch.
