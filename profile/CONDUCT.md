# TucsonJS Code of Conduct

TucsonJS is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable community and environment for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion (or lack of), or age. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form â€“ this includes jokes made about the aforementioned qualities of personhood, even when made ironically.

If someone asks you to stop behavior that is perceived as inappropriate, leave them alone, or end a conversation, do just that. The conversation is now over.

Harassment includes deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual or violent language and imagery are not appropriate for any TucsonJS presentation or sponsorship material.

Participants, speakers, volunteers, or sponsors violating these rules may be warned, sanctioned, expelled, or banned from the event at the discretion of the organizers. If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify an organizer as soon as you are able.

Thank you for keeping TucsonJS a welcoming, uplifting, community for everyone!
